1. What is Git?
Git is a version control system. It helps track changes in code or files. You can go back to previous versions, work with others, and manage code easily.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the tool used on your computer to manage code.

GitHub is a website where you can store your Git projects online and collaborate with others.

3. What is a repository (repo)?
A repository is a folder that Git is tracking. It contains your project files and the history of changes.

4. What is the difference between git clone, git pull, and git fetch?
git clone: Copies an entire repo from GitHub to your computer.

git pull: Downloads changes from GitHub and updates your code.

git fetch: Downloads changes, but doesn’t update your code until you merge.

5. What is git commit?
git commit saves your changes to the local Git history. It’s like taking a snapshot of your work.

6. What is the difference between git add and git commit?
git add: Tells Git which changes to track.

git commit: Saves those changes in Git history with a message.

7. What is a branch in Git?
A branch is like a copy of your code where you can try new changes without affecting the main version. You can merge it later if everything works fine.

8. What is git merge?
git merge is used to combine changes from one branch into another (usually from a feature branch into the main branch).

9. What is a conflict in Git?
A conflict happens when two people change the same part of a file. Git can’t decide which change to keep, so you have to fix it manually.
